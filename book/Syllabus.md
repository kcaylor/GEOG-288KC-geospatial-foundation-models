## **GEOG 288KC: Geospatial Foundation Models and Applications**

**Fall 2025**
**Fridays 9am-12pm \+ optional lab office hours Fridays 2pm-5pm**

---

### **Course Overview**

This accelerated, hands-on seminar provides practical skills for working with state-of-the-art geospatial foundation models. Students learn to apply pretrained models to real-world problems using TerraTorch and PyTorch Lightning workflows, covering embedding analysis, image reconstruction, temporal prediction, classification, object detection, and semantic segmentation. The course emphasizes immediately applicable skills and production-ready workflows rather than building models from scratch.

---

### **Prerequisites**

* Students should have some experience with remote sensing, geospatial data, or ML (e.g., Python, Earth Engine, PyTorch)
* Access to UCSB AI Sandbox for computational resources
* Basic familiarity with satellite imagery and environmental applications

---

### **Applications**

To apply, students should submit a paragraph at the [form link](https://forms.gle/Q1iDp2kuZuX1avMPA) below describing their past experience with remote sensing, geospatial data, and ML, as well as their interest in applying Geospatial Foundation Models to practical problems. They should describe a specific geospatial application area they want to explore. The more clearly defined the target application and any existing datasets the better.
