### Key Concepts

#### Foundation Models

- **Pretraining**: Self-supervised learning on massive unlabeled data
- **Transfer Learning**: Adapting pretrained models to new tasks
- **Fine-tuning Strategies**:
  - Linear probing (freeze backbone)
  - Full fine-tuning (update everything)
  - LoRA/adapters (efficient partial updates)

#### Data Handling

- **STAC APIs**: Standardized data discovery
- **TorchGeo Datasets**: Geospatial-aware data loading
- **Tiling**: Handling large images
- **Normalization**: Per-band statistics for remote sensing

#### Training

- **PyTorch Lightning**: Structured training loops
- **Callbacks**: Checkpointing, early stopping, LR scheduling
- **Mixed Precision**: Faster training with 16-bit
- **Reproducibility**: Seed setting, deterministic algorithms

## Best Practices Summary

### Data Preparation

```python
# 1. Use established datasets when possible
from torchgeo.datasets import EuroSAT

# 2. Apply appropriate normalization
transform = Normalize(mean=SENTINEL2_MEAN, std=SENTINEL2_STD)

# 3. Handle large images with tiling
tiles = create_tiles(image, tile_size=512, overlap=64)

# 4. Split data appropriately (spatial/temporal awareness)
train, val, test = spatial_split(dataset, ratio=[0.7, 0.15, 0.15])
```

### Model Selection

```python
# 1. Start with linear probing
task = ClassificationTask(..., freeze_backbone=True)

# 2. Move to full fine-tuning if needed
task = ClassificationTask(..., freeze_backbone=False, lr=1e-4)

# 3. Use appropriate architecture for task
# - Classification: backbone + head
# - Segmentation: encoder + decoder (UNet, FPN)
# - Detection: backbone + RPN + heads
```

### Training

```python
# 1. Use Lightning for structured training
trainer = L.Trainer(
    max_epochs=50,
    callbacks=[checkpoint, early_stop],
    precision="16-mixed",
)

# 2. Monitor appropriate metrics
# - Classification: accuracy, F1
# - Segmentation: IoU, F1
# - Detection: mAP@0.5

# 3. Save checkpoints regularly
checkpoint = ModelCheckpoint(save_top_k=3, monitor='val_loss')
```

### Evaluation

```python
# 1. Use held-out test set
trainer.test(task, datamodule)

# 2. Visualize predictions
visualize_predictions(images, predictions, ground_truth)

# 3. Analyze errors
confusion_matrix(y_true, y_pred)
error_analysis(failures)
```

### Deployment

```python
# 1. Export model
torch.onnx.export(model, dummy_input, "model.onnx")

# 2. Create demo
demo = gr.Interface(fn=predict, inputs="image", outputs="label")

# 3. Document thoroughly
# - Model card
# - API documentation
# - Usage examples
```
